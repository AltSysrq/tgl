Installing TGL

Dependencies:
You only need a C compiler and the standard UNIX utilities to build TGL. TGL
has commands for running Perl and Tcl; you will obviously need those programs
in order to use those commands, but they are otherwise not required for
anything.

Building:
You can compile TGL by running
  ./configure
  make

Installing:
Just run
  make install
or
  sudo make install
Integrating into your favourite editor is generally more a question of your
user configuration than being installed, so see the files under doc/examples
for information on integrating with various editors.

Uninstalling:
Like installing:
  make uninstall
or
  sudo make uninstall
