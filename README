DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Runs the Text Generation Language interpreter on the script read from
     standard input.

     tgl supports the following options:

     --hh      Show usage and exit.

     --pp      Search for prefix payload data.

     --cc _c_o_n_t_e_x_t
             Specify the current context (for conditional execution).

     --ll _l_i_b_r_a_r_y
             Use the file specified by _l_i_b_r_a_r_y (instead of ~/.tgl) for the
             user library.

     --rr _f_i_l_e
             Use _f_i_l_e (instead of ~/.tgl_registers) for register persistence.

     When Tgl starts up, it first restores registers from the register persis-
     tence file (by default, ~/.tgl_registers), then executes the user library
     if it exists (by default, ~/.tgl). Any errors in either of these steps
     are reported but otherwise ignored.

     The script to execute is then read from standard input, until EOF is
     reached. The script is then executed; if any error occurs, execution is
     aborted. If no errors are encountered, the final state of the registers
     is written back to the register persistence file.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     ttggll exits with status 0 on success. An exit status of 1 indicates failure
     due to an error in the input program. Stati 253--255 indicate failures
     due to external conditions.

     Every value in Tgl is a string. A string is simply a sequence of arbi-
     trary 8-bit bytes of arbitrary length. Some commands will interpret the
     strings as integers or booleans. An integer is a string beginning with a
     "+" or "-", followed by any number of base-10 digits. Base-16 (hexadeci-
     mal) may be specified by prefixing the digits with "0x", base-8 (octal)
     by "0o", or base-2 (binary) by "0b".  A boolean string is false if it is
     the empty string or if it is a valid representation of numeric zero. Any
     other string is considered true.

   SSTTAACCKK
     The stack is the primary method of passing data to and from commands.
     With few exceptions, all commands only pop values from and push values to
     the top of the stack. There is no limit on stack height, other than
     available memory. It is an error to try to pop from the stack when it is
     empty.

   RREEGGIISSTTEERRSS
     Tgl provides the programmer with exactly 256 registers, each correspond-
     ing to a single byte value. Each register contains one string, and also
     stores its time of last access. Other than the history system, commands
     do not use registers except when doing so to present functionality to the
     user.

     Registers are all initialised to empty strings. When Tgl exits success-
     fully, it will write the state of all registers to the register persis-
     tence file. This file is read back in the next time Tgl runs, so regis-
     ters will preserve their values across invocations of Tgl.

     Registers 0x00..0x1F (ie, the byte values) are used to store command his-
     tory, where register 0 is the most recently run command sequence. When
     TGL runs successfully and history was not suppressed, and the command
     sequence was not "hX", the command sequence is added to the history by
     moving 0x00..0x1E each one register up, then inserted to register 0x00.

     Some commands take optional parameters via a secondary argument system.
     There are four secondary argument slots, called U0..U3. Unlike registers,
     they cannot be accessed directly, and may be null. Any command which
     takes secondary arguments nullifies all four slots after execution. There
     is also the secondary index, UX, which indicates which slot is used next.
     It starts at zero, and is incremented whenever a secondary argument is
     set. It is zeroed when a secondary-argument-using command completes exe-
     cution.

     A secondary argument is considered "set" when UX has advanced beyond its
     own index. It is considered "provided" when it is set and non-null.

     Commands which use secondary arguments indicate such usage similar to the
     example below:
           Secondary: [value = default] [provided] (set?)

     Brackets indicate that the argument is considered if provided; paranthe-
     ses, if set. Items of the format value=default indicate a property which
     has the given default if the argument is not provided, but which takes
     the value of any argument which is provided. Items of the format prop-
     erty? indicate booleans which are false unless the argument is provided
     or set (depending on whether brackets or parentheses are used), regard-
     less of the argument's value. Any argument not noted is silently ignored.

     The u (secondary-argument) command is used to set secondary arguments.
     What it does depends on the following character:

     %       Pop a value from the main stack and use it to provide the next
             argument

     space   Set the next argument to null

     digit   Evaluate the following digits (using the number command) and use
             the result to provide the next argument

     - +     Same as digit

     .       Provides an integer corresponding to the current stack height as
             the next argument.

     other   Create a one-character string with the given character and use it
             to provide the next argument

     In some cases, it is desirable to take data from a structured source,
     either embedded in the script itself, or extracted from an external
     source. The , command provides functionality to access and manipulate
     this payload data.

     Most commonly, one includes payload data within the script itself. Usu-
     ally, payload data starts after the text ",$", though the delimiter can
     be changed. By passing the -p (or --prefix-payload) flag, it is also pos-
     sible to include a payload at the beginning of input. In this case, code
     is considered to start after the first "|" (though initial whitespace
     (for the ` character within strings) still counts within the payload).
     Multiple pipes can be used to include the "|" within the payload; the
     first occurance that has the greatest number of pipes is used to separate
     the payload and the code.

     The first occurrance of a payload-data command which requires access to
     the payload will search for the start-of-payload delimiter (default ",$")
     in the code if no payload is already present.

   CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     All "true commands" in TGL are represented by a single character. When-
     ever the interpreter must execute a command, it looks at the character at
     the interpreter's current instruction pointer, and runs the associated
     command. All whitespace characters are implicitly considered no-op com-
     mands. If the command completes successfully, the instruction pointer is
     incremented.

     Builtin commands have access to all interpreter state, including the code
     and instruction pointer itself. Many commands will move the instruction
     pointer to effect control and quoting mechanisms. See the description for
     each command.

   CCOONNTTEEXXTT
     TGL is run with a context (the empty string if not given) and maintains
     whether the context is active. The context is typically specified as a
     filename. Some commands only have effect if the context is active, allow-
     ing for language- or project-specific functionality.

     x (swap: a{depth} b -> b a{depth}, or b a{-depth} -> a{-depth} b)
                   Secondary: [depth = 1]
             The top two items on the stack are swapped. With a secondary
             argument, this rolls the top element under that many items if
             positive, or moves an item at that depth to the top if negative.

     : (dupe: item -> item{times+1})
                   Secondary: [times = 1]
             Pops an item from the stack, then pushes (times+1) copies of it
             onto the stack.

     ; (drop: item{times} -> ())
                   Secondary: [times = 1]
             Pops (times) items from the stack and discards them.

   SSTTRRIINNGGSS
     c (concat: a b -> ab)
             Pops two strings from the stack, concatenates them, and pushes
             the result.

     C (char-at: string index -> char)
             Pops a string and an index, and pushes the character within the
             string at that index. The first character is at index 0. Negative
             indices are relative to the end of the string.

     l (length: string -> length)
             Pops a string from the stack and pushes its length, in bytes.

     m (map: string {from to}{n} n -> result, or string ... -> result)
                   Secondary: [stack-position-of-string = null]
             Translates each occurrance of _f_r_o_m to the corresponding _t_o in
             _s_t_r_i_n_g such that no mappings interact. The number of mappings
             must be specified explicitly on the stack if no secondary argu-
             ment is given; if one is given, it should be a "u." command after
             _s_t_r_i_n_g but before the first mapping.

     s (substr: string from to -> length)
             Pops a string and two indices, evaluated the same was as in char-
             at, and pushes the portion of the string between _f_r_o_m, inclusive,
             to _t_o, exclusive.

     S (suffix: string from -> length)
             Same as substr, but assumes that _t_o is the length of the string.

     y (empty-string: () -> "")
             Pushes the empty string onto the stack.

     " ... " (string: ??? -> string)
             Pushes the characters between the double-quotes as a string onto
             the stack. The following characters are interpreted specially:

             \       Evaluates the \ command at that point and splices the
                     result into the string. Characters continue to be read
                     after the point where \ left off.

             $       Interprets the following character as a register name;
                     the value of this register is spliced into the string at
                     that point.

             %       Pops a value from the stack and splices it into the
                     string at that point.

             `       Inserts the string of whitespace characters that were
                     present before the first non-whitespace character in the
                     primary input.

     ' C (char: () -> string)
             Pushes a single-character string, whose contents is the character
             following the command, to the stack. Note that since TGL is not
             Unicode-aware, this more strictly pushes a single _b_y_t_e.  For
             example, the code
                   'ß
             will not push a string containing an Eszett, but rather (assuming
             UTF-8) a string containing the byte 0xC3; the interpreter will
             then try to execute command 0x9F.

     (...) (code: () -> string)
             Pushes the string between the parentheses verbatim. The parenthe-
             ses must be balanced; for example, the code
                   (foo (bar) baz)
             pushes the string
                   foo (bar) baz

     . (print: string -> ())
             Pops a string from the stack and writes it verbatim to standard
             output.

     \ (escape: () -> string or () -> ())
             Pushes a single character as indicated by the following charac-
             ter(s).

             Control characters:

             \a      BEL

             \b      BS

             \e      ESC

             \f      FF

             \n      LF

             \r      CR

             \t      HT

             \v      VT

             \x##    The byte represented by the hexadecimal integer _#_#.

             The following result in the character being escaped:
                   \" \\ \$ \% \` \'

             The following result in nothing (not even a string is pushed);
             they may be used for manual balancing of parentheses as required
             by some commands.
                   \( \) \[ \] \{ \} \< \>

     = (equal: a b -> (a==b))
             Pops two strings and pushes a boolean indicating whether they are
             exactly equal.

     ! (not-equal: a b -> (a!=b))
             Pops two strings and pushes a boolean indicating whether they are
             _n_o_t exactly equal.

     { (string-less: a b -> (a<b))
             Pops two strings and pushes a boolean indicating whether the left
             is less than (ASCIIbetically) the right.

     } (string-greater: a b -> (a>b))
             Pops two strings and pushes a boolean indicating whether the left
             is greater than (ASCIIbetically) the right.

   MMAATTHH
     #/digit ... (number: () -> integer)
             Reads an integer and pushes it onto the stack, stopping on the
             first non-digit. Any digit (0..9) is bound to this command; the #
             command also allows a leading sign before the number itself.

     ? (rand: () -> integer)
             Pushes a random integer between 0 and 65535, inclusive, onto the
             stack.

     + (add: a b -> (a+b))
             Pops two stack elements, interprets them as integers, and pushes
             their sum onto the stack.

     - (sub: a b -> (a-b))
             Pops two stack elements, interprets them as integers, and pushes
             their difference onto the stack.

     * (mul: a b -> (a*b))
             Pops two stack elements, interprets them as integers, and pushes
             their product onto the stack.

     / (div: a b -> (a/b))
             Pops two stack elements, interprets them as integers, and pushes
             their quotient onto the stack.

     % (mod: a b -> (a%b))
             Pops two stack elements, interprets them as integers, and pushes
             their remainder onto the stack.

     < (less: a b -> (a<b))
             Pops two integers and pushes a boolean indicating whether the
             left is less than the right.

     > (greater: a b -> (a>b))
             Pops two integers and pushes a boolean indicating whether the
             left is greater than the left.

     & (and: a b -> (a&&b))
             Pops two booleans and pushes the result of logical AND. Note that
             due to the nature of TGL this is not, and cannot be, short-cir-
             cuiting.

     | (or: a b -> (a||b))
             Pops two booleans and pushes the result of logical OR. Note that
             due to the nature of TGL this is not, and cannot be, short-cir-
             cuiting.

     ^ (xor: a b -> (a^b))
             Pops two booleans and pushes the result of logical XOR.

     ~ (not: a -> !a)
             Pops a boolean and pushes its negation.

   RREEGGIISSTTEERRSS
     a (auto-write: value -> ())
             Pops a string and stores it into a register with an alphanumeric
             name. The register chosen is the one with the earliest date of
             last use. After writing the register, prints a string of the for-
             mat
                   `%s: %c\n
             indicating the value stored and the register it was stored in.
             (The first character is a literal grave quote, while the last one
             is a linefeed.)

     p (stash: () -> ())
             Pushes all registers onto a stack independent of the primary
             stack.

     P (retrieve: () -> ())
             Restores all registers as preserved by stash, removing that
             entry.

     r R (read: () -> value)
             Pushes the contents of register _R onto the stack.

     R R (write: value -> ())
             Pops _v_a_l_u_e from the stack and stores it into register _R.

     u X (secondary-argument: () -> () or value -> ())
             The effect of this command depends on _X.  See SECONDARY ARGUMENTS
             above.

     z (stash-retrieve: code -> guarded-code)
             Pops _c_o_d_e and places p...P guards around it, so that no changes
             to registers occur due to execution of _c_o_d_e (assuming it contains
             no ",$").

   PPAAYYLLOOAADD
     All payload commands are prefixed with ",".

     ,$ (payload-start: () -> ())
             Immediately moves the instruction pointer to the end of the cur-
             rent code, effectively stopping processing.

     ,c (payload-curr: () -> elt)
             Pushes the string corresponding to the first element of the cur-
             rent payload data onto the stack.

     ,, (payload-next: () -> ())
                   Secondary: [count = 1]
             Deletes the first _c_o_u_n_t elements from the current payload data.

     ,; (payload-next-kv: () -> ())
                   Secondary: [count = 1]
             Deletes the first _c_o_u_n_t pairs of elements from the current pay-
             load data.

     ,. (payload-print: () -> ())
                   Secondary: [count = 1]
             Prints the first _c_o_u_n_t elements of the payload data, separated by
             the current _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_v_-_d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r, then deletes them. A _c_o_u_n_t of
             zero indicates all elements.

     ,: (payload-print-kv: () -> ())
                   Secondary: [count = 1]
             Prints the first _c_o_u_n_t key-value pairs of the payload data. Each
             key and value is separated by the current _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_k_v_-_d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r,
             and each pair is separated by the current _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_k_v_s_-_d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r.
             A _c_o_u_n_t of zero indicates all pairs.

     ,r (payload-read: () -> payload)
             Pushes the string representation of the current payload data onto
             the stack.

     ,R (payload-write: payload -> ())
             Sets the current payload data to the string popped from the
             stack.

     ,h (payload-length-bytes: () -> byte-count)
             Pushes an integer indicating how many bytes remain in the current
             payload data. Returns zero if and only if no elements remain in
             the current payload. (Thus the mnemonic _H_a_s_-_m_o_r_e)

     ,e (payload-each: ??? body -> ???)
                   Secondary: [reg = "p"]
             For each value in the current payload, set _r_e_g to that value and
             execute _b_o_d_y.  This does not modify the current payload data. The
             result of the payload data having been altered after _b_o_d_y exits
             is undefined.

     ,E (payload-each-kv: ??? body -> ???)
                   Secondary: [key-reg = "k"] [val-reg = "v"]
             For each key-value pair in the current payload, set _k_e_y_-_r_e_g to
             the key and _v_a_l_-_r_e_g to the value, then execute _b_o_d_y.  This does
             not modify the current payload data. The result of the payload
             data having been altered after _b_o_d_y exits is undefined.

     ,i (payload-datum-at-index: index -> value)
             Pushes the payload element at _i_n_d_e_x, where 0 is the index of the
             first element. This operation requires a linear scan of the pay-
             load data.

     ,I (payload-num-indices: () -> count)
             Counts the number of elements in the current payload data and
             pushes the result. This operation requires a linear scan of the
             payload data.

     ,k (payload-datum-at-key: key -> value)
             Pushes the first payload value element which follows the given
             key. This opretation requires a linear scan of the payload data.

     ,/ VV (payload-set-property: value -> ())
             Sets the property _V_V to _v_a_l_u_e.  Properties are:

             ps (payload-start, default ",$") The delimiter that separates
                     code from payload in the main body.

             vd (value-delimiter, default "ws" (see ",s")) The delimiter that
                     separates elements in the payload data.

             ov (output-v-delimiter, default ", ") The string to separate con-
                     tiguous normal values on output.

             ok (output-kv-delimiter, default ", ") The string to separate
                     keys from values on output.

             os (output-kvs-delimiter, default "\n") The string to separate
                     key-value pairs on output.

             b( b[ b{ b< (balance-paren) Set to any boolean. If true, delim-
                     iters are ignored when between yet-unbalanced pairs of
                     the given type of parenthesis character. If false, the
                     characters are treated normally. Default is true for ([{,
                     false for <.

             t( t[ t{ t< (trim-paren) Set to any boolean. If true, up to one
                     single matching pair of the given parenthesis type is
                     trimmed from a value before extraction. This is performed
                     after whitespace trimming, and no further trimming is
                     done after this step. Default is true for ([{, false for
                     <.

             ts (trim-space, default true) Set to any boolean. If true, extra-
                     neous spaces around values are trimmed when being
                     extracted.

     ,? VV (payload-get-property: () -> value)
             Pushes the current value of property _V_V.  See ",/".

     ,s (payload-space-delimited: () -> ())
             Sets payload to be delimited by whitespace of any kind, combina-
             tion, and abount. Resets balance and trim properties to defaults.
             If this mode is in use when payload is first extracted (or with
             any command which alters the payload), leading space in the pay-
             load is skipped. This is indicated in delimiter properties with
             the special string "ws".

     ,0 (payload-nul-delimited: () -> ())
             Sets payload to be delimited by NUL characters, and sets all bal-
             ance and trim properties to false.

     ,l (payload-line-delimited: () -> ())
             Sets the following strings:
                   "\n" "\r" "\r\n"
             as the value delimiter, and sets all paren-related balancing and
             trimming to false. Space trimming is set to true.

     ,! (payload-from-code: () -> ())
             Extracts the payload from the suffix from the top-level primary
             code, using the current _p_a_y_l_o_a_d_-_s_t_a_r_t delimiter. This is automat-
             ically done if no payload has ever been extracted when a command
             that accesses the payload data is run.

     ,f (payload-from-file: filename -> ())
             Reads the entire contents of _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e and uses it as payload
             data.

     ,F (payload-from-glob: glob -> ())
             Accumulates all filenames matching _g_l_o_b and stores them into the
             payload data, NUL-delimited. Implicitly executes ",0" after.

   CCOONNTTRROOLL SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS
     d (defun: name body -> ())
             Defines the command of the given name, which may be standard (one
             character long) or long (more than one character long). It is an
             error if it already exists. After execution of this command, the
             new command can be invoked in the normal manner (directly if a
             standard name, or with Q... if it is long).

     D (defun-contextual: name body -> ())
             Like defun except that nothing happens if the current context is
             not active.

     e (each: ??? string body -> ???)
                   Secondary: [reg = "c"]
             For each character in _s_t_r_i_n_g, set _r_e_g to a string with that char-
             acter as its only content, then execute _b_o_d_y.

     f (for: ??? to body -> ???)
                   Secondary: [from = 0] [reg = "i"] [increment = +1 or -1]
             Set _r_e_g to _f_r_o_m.  Execute _b_o_d_y, then add _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t to _r_e_g.  If
             _r_e_g has not moved to the other side of _t_o from whence it started
             and is not equal to _t_o, the command repeats. If _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t is not
             given, it defaults to +1 if _t_o is greater than _f_r_o_m, or -1 other-
             wise.

     i (if: ??? condition then else -> ???)
             If _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n is a true boolean, executes _t_h_e_n; otherwise, exe-
             cutes _e_l_s_e.  Other than the three arguments given, the effect on
             the interpreter is entirely dependent on the code executed. Note:
             _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n is a _v_a_l_u_e, not code to execute. The code
                   (1 2=)('y)('n)i.
             will print "y" since "1 2=" is a true string. For the desired
             effect, the code should read
                   1 2=('y)('n)i.

     I (if-short: ??? condition then -> ???)
             The same as if except that it does nothing if _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n is false.

     Q ... (long-command: ??? -> ???)
             Reads characters from the code until end of input or whitespace
             is encountered. These characters (excluding the leading "Q") con-
             stitute a long command name. The command corresponding to this
             name is executed. The way the interpreter is affected depends
             entirely on what the command does.

     v (save-code: name code -> ())
             Creates a defun using the given name and code, executes it (the
             defun, not the code), and appends the definition to the user
             library if successful.

     V t (save-code-contextual: name code -> ())
             Like save-code, but also restricts the definition to the context
             indicated by _t.  If _t is "s", the whole context must match; if it
             is "e", only the extension must match. No other values of _t are
             permitted.

     w (while: ??? condition body -> ???)
             Executes _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n and pops a value from the stack. If it is
             false, the command stops. Otherwise, _b_o_d_y is executed and the
             command repeats. Notice that unlike if, _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n is code to
             evaluate on each iteration, instead of a value by itself.

     W (while-short: ??? body -> ???)
             Executes _c_o_d_e and pops a value from the stack. If it is true, the
             command repeats.

     X (eval: ??? code -> ???)
             Pops a string from the stack and evaluates it as TGL code. The
             way the interpreter is affected depends entirely on what the code
             does.

   CCOONNTTEEXXTT
     All context commands are prefixed with @.  Any occurrance of "..." in
     these commands indicates that a string is read until the next whitespace
     character. The string "matches" if the glob defined by the string which
     was read (see fnmatch(3)) matches the current context (as with --cc ).

     @= ... (context-set: () -> ())
         The context is made active if matches, inactive if does not match.

     @! ... (context-set-not: () -> ())
         The context is made inactive if matches, active if does not match.

     @& ... (context-and: () -> ())
         The context is made inactive if does not match.

     @| ... (context-or: () -> ())
         The context is made active if matches.

     @^ ... (context-and-not: () -> ())
         The context is made inactive if matches.

     @| ... (context-or-not: () -> ())
         The context is made active if does not match.

     @? (context-active: () -> active-state)
         Pushes a boolean indicating whether the context is active.

     @s (context-query: () -> context)
         Pushes the current context itself.

     @e (context-extension: () -> extension)
         Pushes the filename extension of the context, including the leading
         dot, if present; otherwise, an empty string.

   HHIISSTTOORRYY//LLIIBBRRAARRYY
     h (history-access: () -> entry)
                   Secondary: [off = 0]
             Accesses the item in history at (off+implicit).  _i_m_p_l_i_c_i_t begins
             at 0 and is incremented every time history-access is invoked.

     H (suppress-history: () -> ())
             Prevents the current code from being added to the history.

   EEXXTTEERRNNAALL CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     b (shell-script: input script -> output)
             Executes ".Ar $SHELL -c _s_c_r_i_p_t _" using _i_n_p_u_t as its standard
             input. Output is accumulated and pushed onto the stack when the
             command completes.

     B (shell-command: input args{n} n -> output, or input ... -> output)
                   Secondary: [stack-depth-of-input = null]
             Execute the given shell command, the arguments pushed in the
             order they will be used. The first argument is the command to
             run. No additional processing is performed on the arguments
             given: They are passed to the program verbatim (this means, for
             example, that no quoting is necessary). Example:
                   yu."echo" "hello" "world"B. --> hello world
             Standard input is provided by _i_n_p_u_t; standard output is accumu-
             lated into _o_u_t_p_u_t and pushed when the command completes.

     j ... (sed: input -> output, or input script -> output)
             Executes "sed -r" on the given input, pushing the output onto the
             stack. The script is normally read in after the command name
             itself, and follows this pseudo-extended-regex:
                   (${STATEMENT};\s*)*${STATEMENT}
             where
                   ${STATEMENT} = [a-zA-Z](.)[^\1]*\1[^\1]*\1[a-zA-Z]*
             If no script follows the command, it is instead popped from the
             stack. The environment variable _T_G_L___S_E_D can be used to override
             the name of the sed command.

     J (perl: input script -> output)
             INvokes "perl -E" with the given script and standard input. The
             environment variable _T_G_L___P_E_R_L can be set to override the location
             of the perl executable.

     t (tcl: input script -> output)
             Invokes "tclsh" with the given input and script, and pushes the
             output onto the stack. The executable name can be overridden with
             the environment variable _T_G_L___T_C_L.
